# YRT-PET
The Yale Reconstruction Toolkit for Positron Emission Tomography (YRT-PET)
is an image reconstruction software for PET imaging.

YRT-PET is currently focused on OSEM reconstructions in List-Mode and
Histogram format.

Current features include:
- GPU acceleration with NVIDIA CUDA
- Python bindings with pybind11
- Event-by-event motion correction
- Siddon, multi-ray Siddon and Distance-Driven projectors
  - Time-of-Flight Support
  - Projection-space PSF support for the Distance-Driven projector
- Image-space PSF
- Image-space post-reconstruction motion correction
- Additive corrections (Scatter & Randoms)
- Normalization correction (Detector sensitivity)
- Attenuation correction
- Scatter estimation (Limited support, without ToF)

Setup and usage instructions can be found in the
[documentation](https://yrt-pet.readthedocs.io/).
However, this project's documentation is still a work in progress.

# Usage

## Command line interface

The compilation directory should contain a folder named `executables`.
The following executables might be of interest:

- `yrtpet_reconstruct`: Reconstruction executable for OSEM.
  Includes sensitivity image generation
- `yrtpet_forward_project`: Forward project an image into a fully 3D histogram
- `yrtpet_backproject`: Backproject a list-mode or a histogram into an image
- `yrtpet_convert_to_histogram`: Convert a list-mode (or any other datatype
  input) into a fully 3D histogram or a sparse histogram
- (Subject to change) `yrtpet_estimate_scatter`: Prepare a fully 3D
  histogram for usage in OSEM as scatter estimate. Currently experimental and
  incomplete

## Python interface

If the project is compiled with `BUILD_PYBIND11`, the compilation directory
should contain a folder named `pyyrtpet`.
To use the python library, add the compilation directory to your `PYTHONPATH`
environment variable:

```
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:<compilation folder>
```

Almost all the functions defined in the header files have a Python bindings.
more thorough documentation on the python library is still to be written.

# Building YRT-PET

## Requirements

- `pybind11` if compiling the python bindings (ON by default)
- CUDA toolkit if compiling using GPU (ON by default)
- An internet connection to download the `cxxopts`, `nlohmann/json`,
  and `catch2` libraries
- OpenMP, but this is baked into most compilers
- zlib, to read NIfTI images in `.nii.gz` format.

## Configuration and compilation

From the command-line interface:

`git clone git@github.com:YaleBioImaging/yrt-pet.git`\
`cd yrt-pet`\
`mkdir build`\
`cd build`\
`cmake ../yrt-pet/ -DUSE_CUDA=[ON/OFF] -DBUILD_PYBIND11=[ON/OFF]`\
`make`

With `[ON/OFF]` being replaced by the desired configuration

- The `-DUSE_CUDA` option enables or disables GPU accelerated code
  - This option is `ON` by default
- The `-DBUILD_PYBIND11` option enables or disables YRT-PET's python bindings
  - This option is `ON` by default

### Post-compilation steps
- (optional) To run unit tests, run `ctest -V` from the build folder.
- Add the `executables` folder to the `PATH` environment variable
- To check if GPU was successfully enabled for the project, run
  `yrtpet_reconstruct --help`. If the `--gpu` option appears, the program was
  compiled with GPU acceleration.
