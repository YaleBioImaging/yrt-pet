# Building YRT-PET

## Requirements

- `pybind11` if compiling the python bindings (ON by default)
- CUDA toolkit if compiling using GPU (ON by default)
- An internet connection to download the `cxxopts`, `nlohmann/json`,
  and `catch2` libraries
- OpenMP, but this is baked into most compilers
- zlib, to read NIfTI images in `.nii.gz` format.

## Configuration and compilation

`git clone git@github.com:YaleBioImaging/yrt-pet.git`\
`cd yrt-pet`\
`mkdir build`\
`cd build`\
`cmake ../yrt-pet/ -DUSE_CUDA=[ON/OFF] -DBUILD_PYBIND11=[ON/OFF]`\
`make`

With `[ON/OFF]` being replaced by the desired configuration

- The `-DUSE_CUDA` option enables or disables GPU accelerated code
    - This option is `ON` by default
- The `-DBUILD_PYBIND11` option enables or disables YRT-PET's python bindings
    - This option is `ON` by default

## FAQ

- I get a message that look like
  ``Could NOT find ZLIB (missing: ZLIB_LIBRARY ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR)``
    - This means that the zlib library was not found
    - Remedy for Linux:
        - if you use APT: `sudo apt install zlib1g-dev`
        - if you use YUM: `sudo yum install zlib-devel`
    - Remedy for macOS:
        - `brew install zlib-devel`
    - It is a widely used library and is widely available on many platforms.
      Make sure to check online if the above solutions do not work.
- I get a message that looks like:
  ```
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "pybind11" with any
  of the following names:

    pybind11Config.cmake
    pybind11-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "pybind11" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "pybind11_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "pybind11" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
  ```
    - This is because the `pybind11` library was not found. YRT-PET requires the
      `pybind11` sources and CMake files to compile with python bindings.
      Several fixes are possible:
        - Disable Python bindings altogether by adding `-DBUILD_PYBIND11=OFF` to
          the CMake command
        - If you are using Linux with APT: ``sudo apt install pybind11-dev``
        - On macOS: `brew install pybind11`
        - Another fix is to install `pybind11` using `pip` or `conda`.
          ([See documentation for more\
          information](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing.html))
- If compiling with GPU acceleration enabled, note that by default, the
  architecture
  that the code will be compiled towards will be `native`. This means that
  YRT-PET will be compiled for the architecture of the host's GPU. Note that
  YRT-PET requires CMake 3.28+ to build the project
    - One can bypass this behavior using one of the two following ways:
        - Set the `CUDAARCHS` environment variable.
        - Add `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=[CUDA architectures list]`.
    - Example: `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="61;75"`
    - [More information here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/CUDA_ARCHITECTURES.html)
- If compiling with GPU acceleration enabled, make sure the `CUDACXX`
  environment variable
  is set to the location of `nvcc`. Run `echo $CUDACXX` to verify this.
- In order to compile with the python bindings, one needs to have a working
  python installation or activate a virtual environment.
    - The python bindings will only work for the host's Python version and only
      for the CPython implementations.
        - Example: One cannot compile YRT-PET with python bindings using Python
          3.10 and expect them to work within Python 3.11
    - To add the YRT-PET python bindings to the python environment, add
      the `build` folder to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.
    - To test the python bindings,
      run: `python -c "import pyyrtpet as yrt; print(yrt.compiledWithCuda());"`
        - If the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable is not set or misplaced,
          the error will look like:
            - `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyyrtpet'`
        - If there is a mismatch between the python version used to compile
          YRT-PET and the environment's python version, the error will look
          like:
            - `ImportError: No module named pyyrtpet_wrapper._pyyrtpet`
        - If the `PYTHONPATH` environment is properly set and the python
          versions match, the command will either print `True` or `False`.
            - `True` if the project was compiled with `-DUSE_CUDA=ON`
            - `False` if the project was compiled with `-DUSE_CUDA=OFF`
- YRT-PET uses OpenMP to parallelize most of the code. By default,
  YRT-PET will use the maximum amount of threads available. If the environment
  variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is set, YRT-PET will use that number instead.
    - It is common within HPC cluster infrastructures to override this
      environment variable to a smaller number like 4. Beware of such situations
      if computation time is a constraint.
