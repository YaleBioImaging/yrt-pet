Aggregation of the basic ideas on how the reconstruction code should be
made. Note: Italic was used to highlight part that were still unsure or
not decided.

Code standard
=============

We use clang-format for the code formatting. The variable naming
standard goes with the following rules: - All variables should have the
following format: ``prefixes_variableNameInCamelCase_suffixes`` -
Private or protected member variables should have the prefix ``m`` -
Pointer variables, both raw and smart, should have the prefix ``p`` -
Reference variables should have the prefix ``r`` - A device object or
pointer should have the prefix ``d`` - The prefix ``h`` can be used to
highlight that a variable is host-side - Parameters should have the
prefix ``p`` when the variable can be confused with a local or a member
variable - Suffixes should be used only when adding units to a variable
- Constants (both ``constexpr``\ s and macros) should be in all-caps -
Exceptions can be made in a variable’s name when it would damage code
readability or mathematical coherence - Exceptions to ``camelCase`` can
be made if the variable has a single-letter word. ex: ``x``, ``y``,
``n``

Reconstruction code basis:
==========================

-  Core coding language: C++ with c++20 standard

   -  Interface for python

-  Build system: cmake
-  Testing tools:

   -  C++: *catch2*
   -  python: pytest

-  Multi-threading: openMP

   -  *Using MPI? Not sure planned*

-  GPU: CUDA

Priority functionality:
=======================

-  ☐ Scatter estimation with Time-of-flight
-  ☒ Additive corrections
-  ☒ GPU projector
-  ☒ Motion correction directly from List-mode files(s)
-  ☒ Multiplicative corrections
-  ☒ PSF inclusion in the projector

Wish list for a full product:
=============================

-  ☐ **Fully 3D Multiple bed**
-  ☐ Quantitative accuracy
-  ☐ Dead time correction
-  ☐ Decay correction
-  ☐ Dynamic reconstruction
-  ☐ Gated reconstruction
