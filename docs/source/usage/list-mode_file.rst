List-mode file
==============

The default YRT-PET list-mode file is a record of all the events to be
considered for the reconstruction.

::

   Timestamp for event 0 (ms) (uint32)
   Detector1 of the event 0 (uint32)
   Detector2 of the event 0 (uint32)
   TOF position of event 0 (ps) (float32) [Optional]
   Timestamp for event 1 (ms) (uint32)
   Detector1 of the event 1 (uint32)
   Detector2 of the event 1 (uint32)
   TOF position of event 1 (ps) (float32) [Optional]
   ...

The file extension used is ``.lmDat`` by convention. The detectors
specified in the List-Mode correspond to the indices in the scanner’s
LUT.

If the ListMode file contains time-of-flight (TOF) information, the
option ``--flag_tof`` must be used in the executable(s). The TOF value
is the difference of arrival time between detector 2 (t2) and detector 1
(t1): t2 - t1, expressed in picoseconds.

For Python users
----------------

If using python bindings, here’s how to read a ListModeLUT:

.. code:: python

   import pyyrtpet as yrt

   scanner = yrt.Scanner("myscanner.json")
   flag_tof = True  # Indicate whether the list-mode file contains a TOF field
   lm = yrt.ListModeLUTOwned(scanner, "mylistmode.lmDat", flag_tof=flag_tof)

The ``flag_tof`` option specifies if the list-mode contains TOF
information for each event.

List-Mode-DOI file
==================

A more advanced List-Mode format is available for scanners with DOI
layers. The format is similar to the regular List-mode format described
above with DOI layer (encoded in 256 bits) for each detector (from the
inward face of the detector). The ``num_layers`` option in the
reconstruction executable allows binning of the DOI layers from 256
layers to an arbitrary number of layers.

::

   Timestamp for event 0 (ms) (uint32)
   Detector1 of the event 0 (uint32)
   DOI1 of the event 0 (uint8)
   Detector2 of the event 0 (uint32)
   DOI2 of the event 0 (uint8)
   TOF position of event 0 (ps) (float32) [Optional]
   Timestamp for event 1 (ms) (uint32)
   Detector1 of the event 1 (uint32)
   DOI1 of the event 1 (uint8)
   Detector2 of the event 1 (uint32)
   DOI2 of the event 2 (uint8)
   TOF position of event 1 (ps) (float32) [Optional]
   ...
